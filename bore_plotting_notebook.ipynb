    "# SRTM Bore Plotting Notebook - SC0-SC1-SC2\n",
    "This notebook dynamically generates plots for bore data and saves them into an output folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Groundwater Analysis Project Using Bore Data and SRTM Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Groundwater analysis project that integrates SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) data with borehole monitoring for more accurate modeling and management of groundwater resources. This project aims to understand how terrain elevation influences groundwater behavior and to analyze water levels and quality under various conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Components of the Project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SRTM Data Integration:\n",
    "\n",
    "SRTM data provides detailed terrain elevation information, which is used to assess how the landscape affects groundwater flow and aquifer recharge.\n",
    "By understanding terrain elevation, Mathews can model how water moves across and within the landscape, impacting where and how quickly water infiltrates into the aquifer.\n",
    "This integration allows for a more comprehensive analysis of the relationship between topography and groundwater dynamics, which is crucial for sustainable water resource management.\n",
    "Borehole Monitoring and Conditions: Mathews is analyzing different borehole conditions to monitor water levels, water quality, and predict future trends. The conditions being tracked are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SC0 (No Injection/Natural Condition):\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents the baseline natural state of the boreholes or aquifer with no external interventions (injection).\n",
    "It provides a reference point to compare the effects of human activities or natural events.\n",
    "\n",
    "* SC1 (Existing Injection Condition):\n",
    "\n",
    "SC1 monitors the current state of the aquifer where injection is happening (e.g., injecting water, chemicals, or other substances into the borehole).\n",
    "This condition helps assess how the aquifer is responding to ongoing or recent injections, such as changes in water levels or quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* SC2 (Prediction Condition):\n",
    "\n",
    "SC2 is used to predict future outcomes for the aquifer based on the current state and trends observed in SC0 and SC1.\n",
    "This condition is crucial for forecasting how the aquifer will behave in the future, such as water level recovery after injections stop or the spread of contaminants.\n",
    "Predictive models like SC2 help in planning sustainable groundwater management strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Collection and Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Water level and quality data are collected over time from various boreholes. This data is visualized using time series plots to understand trends and variations.\n",
    "The project includes field observations and automated time series measurements to ensure accurate and comprehensive monitoring of groundwater conditions.\n",
    "Purpose of the Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to provide insights into the behavior of the aquifer system under both natural and human-influenced conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By integrating SRTM terrain data and borehole water-level monitoring, the project aims to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predict future water levels and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assess the sustainability of current water management practices, such as injection schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Help in decision-making for water resource managers by forecasting long-term impacts and providing a better understanding of the aquiferâ€™s response to interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify risks associated with aquifer depletion or contamination and develop strategies for mitigating those risks."
